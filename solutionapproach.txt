Solution approach for fair-billing problem:

- Read the file line by line and extract the  time, username and session status (start/end).
- Fetch earliestTime and latestTime. These will be used later.
- Maintain these extracted details in a map that holds session details of every user.
- Parameters maintained for session details are: username, startTimes, endTimes, totalTime and totalSessions.
- StartTimes and EndTimes are maintained as an array of time.Time object.
- Iterate through StartTimes and EndTimes and subtract start time from end time to calculate session duration.
- Add all session durations to find total session time for that user.
- While calculating session durations, if no end time is found for a started session, use latest time as end time.
  Similarly, if no start time is found for an ended session, use earliest time as end time.
